I have read and tried to understand, but as time goes hopefully it becomes easier. I am having difficulty understanding a 'pull request', what happens whe a pull request is not merged? DOes it continue to sit as an open pull request or cn the authors of the open project decide to delete it?
In a pull request, does it always have to be a coding comparison? Or just a cooment about a project?
